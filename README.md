# Student Management System

A full-featured student management web application with role-based authorization, JWT authentication, and MongoDB integration. Built to handle courses, students, and enrollments efficiently, it provides secure access control for Admins, Students, and Viewers.

## Features

### Role-Based Authorization

- **Admin**
  - Full CRUD operations on:
    - Users
    - Students
    - Courses
    - Enrollment Schemes
  - Can view and manage all data in the system.

- **Student**
  - Can enroll and unroll in courses.
  - Can view their own enrolled courses.

- **Viewer**
  - Read-only access to:
    - List of all students and courses
    - Enrolled courses for any student

### JWT-Based Authentication

- Secure login and signup functionality.
- Only Admins can create new user accounts.
- JWT token is required to access protected routes.

### Student & Course Management

- View all students and courses.
- View single student or course details.
- Search functionality available for users.

### User Profile Management

- Users can update:
  - Username
  - Password

### Unique User Identification

- Every user is assigned a unique `USER_ID`.
- If the user is a student, this ID is mapped to their Student ID for tracking enrollments.

### Tech Stack

  - Collections:
    - `Users`
